kibip

What is kibip?
=================
kibip, written in bash, searches for placeholders in a .html file 
and replaces them with information. Sounds boring, sounds simple - but 
it's powerful!

Placeholders can later contain everything you want, e. g. Feeds, 
your E-Mails, your IP, date, birthday, a calendar, termines, 
diskspace, kernel version, new updates for applications, weather - 
everything. It depends on your fantasy. And of course this submit forms 
for google etc. So yes, this page should be your startpage.  

It is like iGoogle, Netvibes or other "your personal startpage" 
stuff - but in theory, much, much more powerful and on a system 
controlled by you. 

How does it work?
=================
kibip uses common unix tools. The output is used to replace the 
placeholders in the html file. 


Why in bash?
============
spur-of-the-moment decision

The name?
=========
The Kiss principle combined with "Bash Information" and 
"Platform/Portal/Page" or whatever.

The startpage won't be up to date when my browsers loads it!
============================================================
Yes. The startpage is static. Use cron to call kibip frequently or use
CGI to update everything when the browsers loads the page. 

lol. You should have written it in PHP!
=======================================
No.
